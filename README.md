# Car Evaluation Using Decision Tree Algorithm

Welcome to the Car Evaluation project! This repository contains a Python implementation of a decision tree algorithm to evaluate cars based on various features. The project utilizes the Gini impurity criterion and includes a graphical user interface built with Tkinter.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use decision tree algorithms to classify cars based on their attributes. The decision tree model is built using the Gini impurity measure, and the results are presented through a user-friendly Tkinter interface.

## Key Features

- **Decision Tree Algorithm**: Implements a decision tree for car evaluation.
- **Gini Impurity**: Uses Gini impurity to determine the best splits in the decision tree.
- **Tkinter GUI**: Provides an interactive graphical user interface for easier car evaluation.
- **Python**: The entire implementation is done in Python.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harishahamed26/Car-Evalution-using-DecisionTree.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd Car-Evalution-using-DecisionTree
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**

   Ensure you have all the required Python packages installed. You can use `pip` to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   Launch the Tkinter GUI by running the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script to run the Tkinter application.
- `decision_tree.py`: Contains the implementation of the decision tree algorithm.
- `car_evaluation.py`: Includes the logic for car evaluation based on decision tree outputs.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python packages required for this project.
